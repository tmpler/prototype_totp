# Prototype TOTP
This project is a simple example of a Time-based One-Time Password can be generated and used to access a system. The project was built on an Arduino UNO and used an RTC module for the time element of the TOTP. A JavaScript implentation has been made to use the Arduino prototype at https://tmpler.github.io/prototype_totp/ or on the gh-pages branch.

# Educational Purposes Only
This project is for demonstration only, the algorithm used is extremely weak and the security implented is flawed in many ways. This project should not be used outside of an educational environment but readers may learn from this project and implement real TOTP algorithms for better effect.
